useReducer()

syntax:

const [state,dispatch]=useReducer(reducerFunc,initialState);

1. reducerFunc:
    -It is a js function.
    -it is a pure function.
    -it takes state and an action object as arguments
    -it returns some value which becomes the state

    const reducerFunc=(state,action)=>{
        return ...;-->it will become the new state
    }

2. initialState:
   -the value which we want initially

3. state
   -it represent the current value of state

4. dispatch
   -function which updates the value of state
   -it takes an action object as an argument.
   
   i. action object --> {type:" ",payload:" "}
     -it is js object
     -it contains key-value pairs:
      -type: it is a string which defines user intent
      -payload: (optional)-->value which we want to set as a state
